Question 1: What is the data type of each of the following values? (0.5pts each)
A) integer 
B) integer
C) string
D) boolean
E) float
F) string
G) integer
H) float


Question 2: What do the following expressions evaluate to? (0.5pts each)
A) 1.4
B) 1.4
C) 1
D) 169
E) 0
F) 1138purple

H) yellowyellow


Question 3: If you were to enter the following lines into the Python terminal, the third line would result in an error:
print(“hello”)
print(“hello”, “world”)
print(hello)
Explain the cause of the error. (1pt)

The third line caused a NameError which means a variable is not defined in the local or global scope.
Here we did not define variable hello so we got this error.


Question 4: What does the following code print to the console if the user enters 10? (1pt)
user_number = int(input(“Enter a whole number greater than 0”))
x = user_number // 3
x = x ** 3
print(x)

First: user_number = 10 
Second: x = 10 // 3 = 3
third: x = 3 ** 3 = 27
Final: print(27)
Thus, 27 will be printed if the user enters 10
